  // The goal of this chapter is to visually capture the intense, strategic, and ultimately tragic relationships between Cleopatra VII, Julius Caesar, and Mark Antony. The visuals should convey the grandeur of ancient Egypt, the power struggles of Rome, and the intimate yet politically charged connections between these historical figures. The tone should be dramatic, evocative, and rich in historical detail, with a focus on the intersection of love, power, and betrayal.
